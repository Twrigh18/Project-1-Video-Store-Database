This is a project is I did for MYSQL Database class where I build a video store database (Project will be finished after April 16th 2022)
(UNDER CONSTRUCTION)


This project was crating in a MYSQL class that I took at a community college. This project was to create a video store and create a database with customers, movies, and rentals dates. And create relationship between those tables. And look at the data to see if there is a business problem with the video store and if there is, what solution can I provide to make the Video store more successful in the future.

## Creating Database with relationships

To create the video store database, three tables will be needed. The three tables will be the customers, rentals, and videos tables. One option is to use the CREATE TABLES. But that option takes too much time and it is more difficult to visualize the relationship. But the better option to create the relationship is to create an EER diagram which is a diagram where you can create columns and select the datasets in a diagram instead of querying separately.

### Data Types
We want to select certain data types for the data to show. Majority of the data types is VARCHAR in which some columns have characters like Title, but some has the INT where the data only shows numbers and DATE where only the date is shown.
